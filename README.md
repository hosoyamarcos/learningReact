# Learning ReactJS with Webpack React Starter Kit

### This repository is no longer maintained. I strongly recommend using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) instead.

## Getting Started

    npm install
    npm run dev

Then just open http://localhost:8080 in your browser!
